                Interactive Website</h2>

            <p> Nxtgen would involve creating and maintaining a
                website that effectively represents the company's brand
                and services. The website should be user-friendly, visual-
                ly appealing, and provide all necessary information
                about the company's products and services. To achieve
                this, the web development team would need to work
                closely with the company's stakeholders to gather re-
                quirements and determine the best approach to building
                the website. They would then use various web develop-
                ment technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
                a server-side scripting language, to create and deploy
                the website. The goal is to deliver a website that accu-
                rately reflects Nxtgen and provides a positive experi-
                ence for its users.</p>
